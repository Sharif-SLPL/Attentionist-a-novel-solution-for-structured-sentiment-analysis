Novel Solutions for Sentiment Analysis

Currently there are three notebooks:

1. **Karimi_et_al_2020**: My implementation of a baseline for ABSA (Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis) task. [*link*](https://github.com/IMPLabUniPr/BERT-for-ABSA)
2. **Attentionist_SSA**: My proposed model for SemEval 2022 Task 10 Subtask 1 (Structured Sentiment Analysis)
3. **baselines**: Running and evaluating SemEval 2022 Task 10 baselines using its codebase

Data folder includes [SemEval 2022 Task 10](https://github.com/jerbarnes/semeval22_structured_sentiment) data and SemEval 2014-2015 (Pontiki et al. 2014, 2015) data annotated by (Wang et al. 2016, 2017). The latter one is on Targeted Sentiment Analysis task and I obtained it from (Chen et Qian 2020) [github repo](https://github.com/NLPWM-WHU/RACL).
